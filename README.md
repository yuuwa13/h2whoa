## NOTES

<p align="center">
As mentioned in its version name, this is the addition of basic CRUD functions for the user only. I will make a branch with the previous version before it was integrated to laravel should the need for
CRUD functions be done within an immediate timeframe. Going back, due to what I believe is no database yet for the project, the CRUD functions are yet to be determined whether they are properly functional
or not. Anyways I believe it would be preferable not to pull this branch to the main as its functionality remain unknown.
