# **NOTES**  

As mentioned in its version name, this is the addition of basic CRUD functions for the user only. I will make a branch with the previous version before it was integrated into Laravel should the need for CRUD functions arise within an immediate timeframe.  

Going back, due to what I believe is no database yet for the project, the CRUD functions are yet to be determined whether they are properly functional or not.  

Anyways, I believe it would be preferable **not** to pull this branch into the main as its functionality remains unknown.
